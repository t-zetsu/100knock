Brief Personal History
A.D. 585
Prince Shotoku ( later Emperor Shomu ) : He was formally installed as the Crown Prince on March 24 , 645 .
August 5 , 1870 : He was enthroned ( Emperor Junnin ) .
Emperor Tenchi ( his reign lasted from February 3 , 686 to March 5 , 1987 )
He died at the age of 56 on January 24 , 672 .
( The " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) says that he was not able to enter the priesthood , but he was killed in the battle of Uji River and was exiled to Oki . )
Emperor Tenchi 's reign lasted from the beginning to the beginning of the 20th century .
There are several theories about this .
Emperor Tenmu was deeply trusted by him .
There is a theory that says that he was a son of Emperor Tenchi , and that he was a son of Emperor Tenchi , and that he was also a son of Emperor Tenchi , and he was also a son of Emperor Shotoku , and he was also a prince of Emperor Tenmu .
The first case is the Emperor Tenmu who was not the Emperor Tenmu , and the second case is the Emperor Tenmu who died in the year of his enthronement .
The details of the battle are unknown , but it is said that many of them were written after the war .
There is a theory that says that he was ' a son of Emperor Tenchi ' and he was not able to take over the throne after his death , but he was given the title of Emperor , ' Emperor 's father , ' and he was also involved in the planning to make the Emperor 's Empress , Emperor 's mother , Emperor 's mother , ' and died at the age of 62 .
According to the genealogy , it was written by the Prince of Emperor Jinmu , and the Prince was born in 708 .
Emperor Tenmu was not the first Emperor , but he was the only Emperor who was not in the direct line of Emperor Tenmu , and he was the only Emperor who was in the line of Emperor Tenmu .
The remaining portion of the calendar was used for the first time .
The reason why the ' Nihonshoki ' was written is not only because of the lack of historical materials but also because of the lack of historical materials .
( ' Nihonshoki ' ( Chronicles of Japan ) )
Prince Naka no Oe was the prince of Emperor Tenchi , but he was assassinated by SOGA no Iruka .
There are also some theories that he was a member of the Imperial family or a member of the Soga clan after the incident .
Iruka was also killed by Prince Otsu .
It is said that the Emperor Tenmu ordered the compilation of the " Nihonshoki " ( Chronicles of Japan ) , but the plan was not realized because of the lack of historical materials .
There is no doubt that the Emperor Tenchi was not a direct descendant of SOGA no Iruka , but a few other people including Kojiro YOSHIKAWA were against this .
There is a theory that Emperor Tenmu was a child of Emperor Tenmu .
There is a theory that says that he was a son of Emperor Tenchi , and that he was also a son of Emperor Tenchi , and he was also called ' the Prince of Empress . '
Although he was not able to make a comeback , he was ordered to make an effort to make his daughter , Princess Matsu marry Emperor Tenchi , and he was killed by the Soga clan , and therefore , he was ordered to make her marry to Prince Otomo ( later Emperor Tenmu ) , Prince Karu ( later Emperor Tenmu ) , but he was not able to have any children and was exiled to Sado Island .
Empress Jito was the first empress to have been the wife of Emperor Tenchi , but she died before the theory was adopted .
There is a theory that says that the Emperor Tenmu gave him the title of ' Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi ' ( the sword of the Chrysanthemum ) , which was a symbol of the Emperor Tenchi , and that the Emperor Tenmu was also ' Ama no Murakumo no Tsurugi ' ( the sword of the Chrysanthemum ) .
There is a theory that says that the Emperor Tenmu was not a child , but a child of a ' child ' and a ' child ' from the same mother , Prince Otomo .
